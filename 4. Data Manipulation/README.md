# Aim

Use R data frames to study and analyze real-world datasets, perform basic data manipulations, and generate descriptive statistics using R functions.

# Introduction

Data analysis is a crucial aspect of extracting meaningful insights from real-world datasets. In this practical, we will use R data frames to study and analyze a real-world dataset. Through this exercise, we'll perform basic data manipulations and generate descriptive statistics using R functions. This hands-on experience will help you become proficient in handling and analyzing data within the R environment.

# Objectives

The primary objectives of this practical are:

1. Import and explore a real-world dataset using R data frames.
2. Perform basic data manipulations, such as subsetting and filtering.
3. Use R functions to generate descriptive statistics for key variables in the dataset.

# Materials:

- RStudio or R environment installed.
- A real-world dataset (e.g., a CSV file) for analysis.
