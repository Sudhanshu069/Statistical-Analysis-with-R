# Aim:
 Apply R to calculate and visualize measures of central tendency (Arithmetic Mean, Median, Mode) for a given dataset.

# Introduction:

Measures of central tendency, including the arithmetic mean, median, and mode, provide essential insights into the central or typical values within a dataset. In this practical, we will use R to calculate and visualize these measures for a given dataset. Understanding and applying these measures are fundamental skills in statistical analysis and data exploration.

# Objective: 
The main objectives of this practical are:

- Calculate the arithmetic mean, median, and mode for a given dataset.
- Utilize R functions to perform central tendency calculations.
- Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution and central tendency measures.

# Materials:

- RStudio
- R 4.3.2
